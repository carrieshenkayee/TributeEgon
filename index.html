          <li>
            <strong>1908</strong> - Schiele is included in a small exhibition organized by Strauch in Klosterneuburg; the boy's work catches the eye of Heinrich Benesch, a railroad inspector of modest means who will later become one of the artist’s most loyal supporters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1909</strong> - Schiele and his artist friends, dubbing themselves the Neukunstgruppe [New Art Group], agree to a joint exhibition at the Kunstsalon Pisko in December. Schiele withdraws from the Academy of Fine Arts at the end of the spring term.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1910</strong> - Schiele withdraws from the Neukunstgruppe he helped found due to a rivalry with another artist in the group. This, coupled with his leaving the Vienna Academy, causes his uncle to withhold financial support and suggest Schiele enlist in the army.

The first two charges are eventually dropped, but Schiele spends twenty-four days in jail for public immorality on accounts that children have been seen indecently in his studio.

            "If the figures in Schiele’s art dwell on the knife-edge between life and death, it’s because Schiele himself does, too. His works seem to fizzle and crack, as if he’s accumulating intensity, somehow aware his life will soon be cut short. No time for artifice, just life laid bare: angst, thrill, the thrum of flesh. There’s a palpable urgency to his hand, as though he’s asserting his legacy in advance, as if to say: ‘This is it.’"
